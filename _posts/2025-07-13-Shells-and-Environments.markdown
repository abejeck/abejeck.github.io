## What are shells? - 

Shells are how a user interacts with their Operating System, or OS. An Operating System is in charge of managing various compnents of the computer like: managin menory, CPU, and maintaining software/hardware relations. A shell is a command programming language, meaning you can write "commands" or code within the terminal to tell your OS tp perform certain functions. There are many ways to use shells, and there are different types of shells, which I will talk about next.  

- Some examples of an OS include: Ubuntu, Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows

# Command programming languages 
There are two types of shells - CLI's (Command line Interfaces) and GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces)
You can think of an interface like a "cover" or a "hood" for what you want to access. You can make changes and calls to your OS, but you have to do it through an interface. This helps with protecting you OS from potential BLANK. The CLI shells are the interfaces that you use within the command line and a GUI is "pretty", basically has buttons and windows that will do the commands for you instead of you typing them out. One example of a GUI shell is Finder for macOS. They function as interprtors taking in the commands from a user and then translating it to the OS to perform the desired task. 

Some commonly use CLI shells are:
command - line interpretor 
LIST: info abt it (focus on what makes it unique)
- Bourne-again Shell, Bash: 
- Z Shell , Zsh: 
- Korn Shell, Ksh: 

# How to use shells
-- PUT PICTURES/ A LINK TO THE COMMANDS AND THEIR OUTPUT (ex: a file that walks through the steps to run and print a hello world statement or something)
Below are some popular commands that are important to know and understand 
1. Making a directory 
2. Making a file
3. How to see file names
4. How to list files by date
5. how to copy a file
6. How to copy a directory 
7. How to direct inout to files:
8. The "-T" command 

You can also write files that contain "scripts" or code like bash, which you can call from the command line to run the code within the file. To do this:
