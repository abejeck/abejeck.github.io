## Just get started! 

The developer world can be daunting. There are a lot of smart people and as a beginner myself, I can become discouraged when my problem-solving or skills fall short. It is easy to forget that everyone in this field has a starting point and you can't know it all right away. Instead of giving up, or thinking I will never improve, I know that you should **just get started**. That means being proactive in learning and growing as a developer. This can include taking a course, asking others for help, or doing daily code challenges. Whenever I start to feel discouraged, here are a few additional reminders I tell myself to keep on going. 


* **No one is born a programmer** - 

  While certain people have inheriant traits or think a certain way that makes programming easier to come by, **no one** is born knowing   how to code, or how to use different tools. People know what they know by asking questions, trying and failing, and of course, by learning. This is all hard work and a lot of time put in that no one usually sees. It is easy to see success without thinking about how much effort and time it took to get there.
* **One day at a time, one concept at a time** -

  I fall victim to the "all or nothing" mindset when it comes to any coding concepts. I have to know it all, or I feel I don't know it well. This leads to feeling insecure about the skills, knowledge, or understanding. The key idea here is that deep understanding of any topic takes **time** (aka experience) and effort. I can't know it all in a day just like how Rome wasn't built in a day. Don't worry about the lack of understanding you may have, but ensure that you learn as you go. 
* **Small wins compound over time to the big ones** - 

  Taking a little bit of time to learn or work on skills everyday may not seem like alot but adds up overtime. This can be as small as 10 or 15 minutes. I remember when I was crying over **for loops** hoping one day I would understand them...so yeah I've improved. 
* **Be able to see the long term** - 

  This is difficult for me to do but is important when you are trying to improve. Anything worthwhile takes time and being frustrated at the place you are at is ok, but it is important to remebmer that continous **effort** towards improvement will make an impact. Being able to see yourself where you want to be is crucial to believing what you are doing is worth it. If you don't believe you can be better or **see**that you will be better, then time spent on growth won't feel like an investment, but a waste of time. 

I want to use this blog as a place to show that becoming a "genius" or a good developer is a constant journey! I encourage you to follow and join me! 

So, that being said...**Hello World**! First post of many completed!
