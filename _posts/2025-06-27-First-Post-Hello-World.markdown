## Just get started! 

The developer world is daunting. The more I try to learn, the more I realize how little I truly know. I see how much knowledge and understanding other developers have and can easily become discouraged. Here are a few reminders I say to myself of when I start to feel inadequate.
1.  ***No one** is born a programmer*
  While certain people have inheriant traits or think a certain way that makes programming easier to come by, **no one** is born knowing how to code. People know what they know by asking questions, trying and failing, and of course, by learning. This is all hard work that is not seen by anyone and it is easy to see success wihtout thinking about how much effort it took to get there
2. *One day at a time, one concept at a time*
  I fall victim to the "all or nothing" mindset when it comes to any coding concepts. I have to know it all, or I feel I don't know it well. This leads to feeling insecure about the skills, knowledge, or understanding. The key idea here is that deep understanding of any topic takes **time** (aka experience) and effort. I can't know it all in a day just like how Rome wasn't built in a day. Don't worry about the lack of understanding you may have, but ensure that you learn as you go. 
3. *Small wins compounds over time to the big ones*
  Taking a little bit of time , like 10 or 15 minutes, to learn or work on skills everyday, may not seem like alot but adds up overtime. I remember when I was crying over **for loops** hoping one day I would understand them...so yeah I've improved. 
4. *Be able to see the long term*
  This is difficult for me to do but is important when you are trying to improve. Anything worthwhile takes time and being frustrated at the place you are at is ok, but it is important to remebmer that continous **effort** towards improvement will make an impact. Being able to see yourself where you want to be is crucial to believing ehat you are doing it worth it. If you don't believe you can be better or **see** that you will be better, then time spent on growth won't seem like an investment, but a waste of time. 

  I want to use this blog as a place to show that becoming a "genius" or a good developer is a constant journey! I encourage you to follow and join me! 


So, that being said...**Hello World**! First post of many completed!
