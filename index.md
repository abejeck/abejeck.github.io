# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my blog, **The Road to Genius**, which represents the idea that becoming a "Genius" is a journey that includes consistent learning, critical thinking, and working on understanding complex ideas. I've created this space as a personal hub to explore my current interests and share the knowledge I'm gaining along the way.

My primary focus areas right now include: coding fundamentals, cybersecurity and emerging trends. Join me as I try to become a genius!
